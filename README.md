# CVSS score calculator for Dradis

This simple add-on adds a new page under `/calculators/cvss` for you to perform CVSS score calculations:

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 4.0, 3.1, 3.0 Calculator is heavily inspired in the one provided by [FIRST](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0).
